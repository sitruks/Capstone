##### NCAA Basketball Tournament Prediction Model\: Home Field Advantage

##### **Problem**
It may be near impossible to pick a perfect bracket, but I have long wondered if there is a correlation to tournamnent host sites and school location.

##### **Solution**
I will run a prediction model to investigate this further. 

The following metrics will be used:  

- School Location  
- Tournament Site  
- Overall Regular Season Record  
- Tournament Record  
- Home Record  
- Away Record  
- First Half Points Scored v. Second Half  


##### **Data**
Fortunately, this data is readily available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data). Some other data cleaning and sourcing may be required.
